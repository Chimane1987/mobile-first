# Portfolio mobile set up

## For this portfolio website, I will:

set up a new repository and prepare it for development using best practices (e.g. linters).
Build the first 2 sections of the mobile website using the template you chose in the previous step.

In this project I used Flexbox, HTML and CSS.

* Make sure Linter is be set up correctly for this repository.
* Linter result should be green.
* There should be no custom changes to linter config.
* Make sure that you used correct Github Flow.
* Make sure that you documented your work in a professional way.
* Follow our list of best practices for HTML & CSS
